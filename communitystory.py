Your doubts are soon answered as the dark lord utters his first words: your failure as protector is now certain, young Skywalker. You remember why you had came to Earth, to find the last force-sensitive child. The silence is broken by the sound of your lightsaber, emitting a sharp, bright, green light. My failure is not assured yet Malgus, you reply to the dark lord of the sith. Moments later you see a red light emit itslef upon the fog. You try to remember your training with master Yoda on Dagobah, knowing this surely can be your last duel. As the fog clears, you get a good look of your opponent. His battered face full of battle scars, his low, ragged breathing, his black armor and cape all confirm the description given by Master Yoda and Obi-Wan. You gather your compuser and impliment Form V, which you picked after assesing your opponent. The silence between you and Malgus grows, as well as the tension. He seems completely unfazed by your prescence, while you are feeling the unmistakeable cold of the dark side overwhelming you on all sides. Suddenly, you hear the cracking of a tree behind you and you quickly jump to the side to avoid the falling pine tree, manifested by Darth Malgus's strong usage of the force. He quickly lunges at you while you try to stand up; your lightsaber meets his with a loud crack, as you try to muster all the strength possible to just stop him from pushing his saber. In an attempt to escape the situation, you quickly drag your right leg and kick his knee, which gives you an opportunity to jump forwards. As you land behind him, Malgus raises his saber aganist his back to block off your attack, soon a clash of green and red is all that anyone could see, for what looked like an eternity. After 12 minutes of this ongoing duel of fates, the exhaustion has become to settle in. You pull away from the clash, jumping backwards into a clearing sorrounded by tall grass, in which you hide in. You take a moment to re-asses your strategy. It seems as all hope is lost, you know you cant keep this up for much longer. You hear a voice move across the grass. You cannot hide forever Luke, once i kill you and the boy, the last of the jedi will have been erased from the face of the galaxy. Anger flows through your veins, you know you cannot let the last hope of the jedi be eliminated at the hands of the sith. You remembered your family, and what evil had done to them, and how there was no one there to stop it. All of these thoughts formulate into one final rush of strength. You leap out of the grass and pounce on the unsuspecting dark lord of the sith, whom was looking towards the other direction. Adrenaline rushes and flows through your veins, as the only thought in your head was your saber cutting down the rapidly falling back Malgus. You can hear his breath straining with his respiratory device wrapped around the lower half of his face like a lock, trying to feed air into his lungs, while he attempted to face your continous onslaught of attacks. Until, in a stroke of utter luck, Malgus was able to kick you off him, but you do not fall to the ground. In Doing so, he ripped your lightsaber out of your hands using the force. You suddenly feel a wave of fear devour you as Darth Malgus stands before you, holding both sabers in each hand, holding your saber on his right hand and his saber on the left. As quick as you get a moment to catch your breath, he quicly starts speed walking towards you, as you retreat backwards while trying to think of anything to do to stop the innevitable attack. Out of hopelessnes, you decide to stand your ground and fight to the end. Long were the years that i dreamed of this moment, skywalker, when i held the last of your kind by the knees of my blade, and nothing would be left to stop me from achieving absolute power. You do not respond. Malgus prepares to execute you with his now crossed blades. You kneel. After a short pause you sense both blades falling towards your neck. You timed it perfectly. You rolled to the left just before the blades sliced your head off and as soon as Malgus slammed his blades against the ground, you took advantage of his state of shock and used the force to pull his red lightsaber out of the ground. Without wasting any time, you quickly gathered your remaining strength to muster one final attack. You charged straight at Malgus, who was attempting to meet your charge face to face with his saber. But, the element of surprise had already won this battle. The dark lord of the sith stood and looked down to see his own blade impaled onto the center of his chest. You raised your eyes only to see a face filled with horror, as his body fell to the side with a hard thump, leaving nothing but one or two faint breaths and an uninevitable silence. ")
